# JS30Day8_fun_with_canvas

This might have been the most fun assignment so far. This lesson was to create a simple microsoft paint style web application. You can click anywhere on the page and move your mouse around to create an assortment of artistic colors and designs. 

This served as a very good introduction to canvas and inspired me to start looking into it further and possibly design additonal games of my own. 

As always the deployed project can be seen below:
